# API_Testing_Book_Store_API
It's a complete API Testing Project from an interactive document (Swagger UI link), a demo Book Store API along with report generated using newman. In this project at first I have gone through the Swagger UI link and explored the functionalities to understand the request properly. Later using Postman I have executed multiple API request like created an user, generated a token for that particular user, authenticated the user, added some books in the account of that user, updated some books, deleted some books and finally deleted the user. I have also executed some pre-request scripts and test validations/assertions to tests the API requests. And finally I have generated an advanced html format report for the API using newman.
